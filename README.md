# ViDoc: An Interactive Documentation Extension for Visual Studio Code

![ViDoc](https://github.com/bubblegumsoldier/vidoc/raw/main/vidoc.png "ViDoc")

## Vision Statement

In modern software development, clear and comprehensive documentation is key. ViDoc is a VS Code extension that aims to revolutionize how documentation is done by incorporating audio-visual elements directly into your code. The extension enables users to record their screen, providing real-time context and commentary on their actions. The result? Documentation that feels like a pair-programming session.

ViDoc aims to promote collaboration, enhance code comprehension, and simplify the documentation process by providing an intuitive, engaging and interactive way to explain complex code snippets. Rather than just reading about how a piece of code works, ViDoc allows you to show, tell, and share in a more dynamic way.

## How to Use ViDoc

Using ViDoc is as easy as 1-2-3:

1. **Install the extension** - Find ViDoc in the VS Code extension marketplace and install it.
2. **Start Recording** - Once installed, you'll find a "Start Recording" button at the bottom right of your VS Code interface. Click on this button, select your preferred microphone, and the recording will begin immediately.
3. **Document your code** - Your cursor position will mark the start of the recording, and a comment will be inserted that contains a link to the generated mp4 file. This file is saved centrally and referenced in the comment for quick viewing.

Each recording comment comes with a hover tooltip, enabling anyone with the ViDoc extension to instantly preview your video documentation.
